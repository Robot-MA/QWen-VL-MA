Task 1 output:
Given the objects on the table, here is a potential list of tasks a 6-DOF parallel gripper robot arm could perform with descriptions:

```python
tasks_list = {
    "pick_up_pear": "The robot arm picks up the pear from the table.",
    "stack_blocks": "The robot arm stacks the blue, black, and red blocks on top of each other.",
    "sort_blocks_by_color": "The robot arm sorts the blocks into separate piles based on color.",
    "place_bran_flakes_in_bowl": "The robot arm opens the Bran flakes box and pours some into the plastic bowl.",
    "push_button": "The robot arm presses down on the plastic red button.",
    "assemble_LEGO": "The robot arm takes LEGO pieces and puts them together based on a predefined pattern.",
    "organize_coffee_beads": "The robot arm arranges the coffee beads into a specific pattern or container.",
    "squeeze_sponge": "The robot arm picks up the red sponge and applies pressure to mimic a squeezing action.",
    "align_poles": "The robot arm lines up the poles parallel to each other.",
    "insert_square_peg": "The robot arm picks up the square peg and places it into a matching square hole if available."
}
```

Task 2 output:
I'll now prepare the JSON format for each task derived from the list above.

These JSON entries would be part of the "task_lists" array, providing a structured way to represent each task that the 6-DOF parallel gripper robot arm could perform based on the identified objects on the table.
